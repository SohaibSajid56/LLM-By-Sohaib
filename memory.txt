what is data structures|Data structures are techniques to store and organize data efficiently.
what is algorithm|An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem.
what is dsa|DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms.

what is a btree|A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree optimized for disk storage.
what is a bst|A Binary Search Tree stores data in sorted order.
what is avl tree|An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree.
what is heap|A heap is a complete binary tree used for priority queues.
what is trie|A trie is a tree used for efficient string storage and search.
what is graph|A graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges.
what is linked list|A linked list is a linear data structure using pointers.
what is stack|A stack follows Last In First Out order.
what is queue|A queue follows First In First Out order.

what is hashtable|A hash table stores key-value pairs using a hash function.
how does hashtable work|A hash function maps keys to indices for fast lookup.
what is collision|Collision occurs when two keys map to the same index.
what is chaining|Chaining resolves collisions using linked lists.

what is recursion|Recursion is when a function calls itself.
what is base case|A base case stops recursion.
what is time complexity|Time complexity measures algorithm efficiency.
what is space complexity|Space complexity measures memory usage.
what is big o|Big-O notation describes worst-case performance.

what is c++|C++ is a high-performance programming language.
what is oop|Object-Oriented Programming uses classes and objects.
what is class|A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
what is object|An object is an instance of a class.
what is inheritance|Inheritance allows a class to reuse another class.
what is polymorphism|Polymorphism allows different implementations of the same function.
what is encapsulation|Encapsulation hides internal implementation details.

what is pointer|A pointer stores a memory address.
what is reference|A reference is an alias for a variable.
what is dynamic memory|Dynamic memory is allocated at runtime.

what is ai|Artificial Intelligence enables machines to mimic human intelligence.
what is machine learning|Machine learning allows systems to learn from data.
what is deep learning|Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers.
what is llm|A Large Language Model processes and generates text.

what is render|Render is a cloud platform for hosting applications.
what is docker|Docker packages applications into containers.
what is api|An API allows communication between software systems.
what is http|HTTP is a protocol for web communication.
what is rest api|A REST API follows stateless client-server architecture.
what is json|JSON is a lightweight data exchange format.

what is memory engine|A memory engine stores prompts and responses persistently.
what is disk persistence|Disk persistence allows data to survive restarts.
what is cache|A cache stores frequently used data in memory.
what is ram|RAM is temporary high-speed memory.
what is disk|Disk provides permanent data storage.

why use btree|B-Trees are efficient for large disk-based datasets.
why use hashtable|Hash tables provide fast O(1) average lookup.
difference between bst and btree|BST is binary; B-Tree allows multiple keys per node.
difference between stack and queue|Stack is LIFO, Queue is FIFO.

what is segmentation fault|A segmentation fault occurs due to invalid memory access.
what is null pointer|A null pointer points to no memory location.
what is memory leak|A memory leak occurs when memory is not freed.

what is normalize|Normalization converts input into a standard format.
why normalize input|Normalization improves matching and memory reuse.
what is similarity matching|Similarity matching compares meaning instead of exact text.

thank you|You're welcome!
