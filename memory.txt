what is data structures|Data structures are ways to organize and store data efficiently.
what is a btree|A B-Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure used in databases and file systems.
what is a hashtable|A hash table stores key-value pairs and allows fast lookup using hashing.
what is normalization|Normalization is the process of converting input into a consistent format.

what is c++|C++ is a high-performance programming language used for system and application development.
what is oop|Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm based on objects and classes.
what is a pointer|A pointer is a variable that stores a memory address.

what is ai|Artificial Intelligence refers to machines that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence.
what is machine learning|Machine learning is a subset of AI that learns patterns from data.
what is an llm|A Large Language Model is trained on massive text data to understand language.

what is render|Render is a cloud platform used to deploy backend and frontend services.
what is docker|Docker is a tool used to containerize applications for consistent deployment.
what is crow|Crow is a C++ micro web framework used to build HTTP servers.

what is memory engine|A memory engine manages short-term and long-term storage of prompts and responses.
what is disk persistence|Disk persistence ensures data survives server restarts.
what is cache|A cache stores frequently used data in fast-access memory.

how does btree search work|B-Tree search works by traversing nodes based on key comparisons.
how does hashtable work|A hash table uses a hash function to map keys to storage locations.
why use btree|B-Trees are efficient for disk-based storage and large datasets.

what is time complexity|Time complexity measures how fast an algorithm runs as input size grows.
what is big o|Big-O notation describes the worst-case complexity of an algorithm.
what is recursion|Recursion is a function calling itself to solve smaller subproblems.
